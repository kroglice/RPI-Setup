# Before we can increase our Raspberry Pi’s swap file, we must first temporarily stop it.
sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff

# Next, we need to modify the swap file configuration file.
sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile
sudo vim /etc/dphys-swapfile

# Within this config file, find the following line of text.
CONF_SWAPSIZE=100

#To increase or decrease the swap file, all you need to do is modify the numerical value you find here.
#This number is the size of the swap in megabytes.
#For example, if we wanted to increase our swap size to 1GB, we would change that line to the following.
CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024

# I use:
CONF_SWAPSIZE=2048

# Once you have made the change, save the file.
# We can now re-initialize the Raspberry Pi’s swap file by running the command below.
sudo dphys-swapfile setup

# With the swap now recreated to the newly defined size, we can now turn the swap back on.
# To start the operating systems swap system, run the following command.
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon

# If you want all programs to be reloaded with access to the new memory pool, then the easiest way is to restart your device.
sudo reboot

# All setuped and Done!!!
